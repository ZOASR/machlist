Pre-heat oven is used in raising the temperature before the casting process of restructuring in addition it is used in a heating of metal alloys in solid state and keep it at a constant temperature until it is cooled for the purpose of changing the condition of its (Microstructure) and giving it the natural and mechanical properties required by the heat treatment.
