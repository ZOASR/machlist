Wood shaper is used for straight and irregular shaping, matched shaping, tonguing and grooving, fluting and decorative molding. It is simple to operate and does superior work quickly and accurately. High speed is an important factor in assuring clean cutting performance on any shaper.

Shaper cuts stock to a particular pattern or profile by employing a rapidly rotating multibladed cutter mounted to a vertical spindle.

The spindle is designed so it can be raised or lowered in fractional increments to meet the work at a precise point; in addition, spacers can be used to position the cutter at different heights on the spindle.

The edge of the work is guided along an adjustable fence .As the stock passes the spinning blades, it's shaped to match the cutter's profile. Hundreds of profile designs could be shaped using shaper machine to fashion anything .
