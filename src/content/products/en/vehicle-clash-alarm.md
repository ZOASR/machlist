Vehicle clash alarm is a system of adjustable distance sensor which triggers two side stop lights.

The clash alarm is fixed inside the vehicle just behind the rear window and its lights is triggered if any other vehicle comes from behind closer than the adjusted distance.

The distance sensor is an opto-electronic distance measuring module for vehicle alarm applications.

The module operates on basis of non-contact comparative phase measurement with amplitude modulation.

The measured result is available on the data interface.

A digital switching output and An analogue 4...20mA output. Analog output signal is directed to ignite two side lights.

The alarm set alignment can be easily achieved through set base with the help of the red pilot laser.
