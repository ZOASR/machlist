The pipe threading machine is used to cut pipes into equal lengths. The machine is adjusted and these pieces are threaded from both sides, internally or externally, to the required length and thread pitch.

The threading machine consists of a unit to hold the pipe, followed by a unit to pull the pipe that automatically determines the length of the cut through the PLC automatic control unit. Pulling can also be done manually from the manual control panel.

Then the pulling unit follows the pipe fixing unit and works to tighten the pipe during cutting. It also works through the PLC automatic control unit, and installation can also be performed manually from the manual control panel.

The cutting unit comes directly after the installation unit, where the cutting process begins after the pulling and installation process is complete. Control is done through the PLC automatic control unit, and cutting can be performed manually from the manual control panel.

After the cutting unit comes the moving cart, where it takes the piece of pipe to the threading unit and then returns it automatically after the threading to run it on the other side to complete the threading process. Then it returns to the cutting unit to take another piece. It is also controlled through the PLC automatic control unit, and the threading can also be performed manually from a panel. Manual control.

The threading process takes place in the final stage on the machine, where the threading pen is installed in the threading unit according to the size of the required tooth, whether internal or external threading. The length of the threading is controlled through the PLC automatic control unit, and threading can also be performed manually from the manual control panel.

Finally, the machine is loaded onto a base made of steel plates that gives the appropriate operating height. It is also equipped with a tool box under the base of the machine.

# Technical Specifications:

-   The base of the machine is treated against rust and painted with two layers of the appropriate color.
