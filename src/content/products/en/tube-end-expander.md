# Reliable Hydraulics :

The Low Hydraulic system is designed as per international practices & assembled with internationally reputed.

Valves are mounted on a specially designed compact manifold block minimizing piping & chances of leakage.

Double sealing arrangement prevents scratching of bore in case of seal failure & back up seal offers additional sealing enabling to use machine for some time at a little pressure drop while awaiting seal replacements, thus avoiding downtime.

# Cylinders :

Efficient 8" diameter hydraulic cylinder
The cylinder assembly is complete , Seals set including piston seals, wiper seals, 'O'- rings, & Rod seals to give leakproof operation, Ram is hardchrome plated to give longer seal life & Corrosion resistance. Seamless honed barrel (steel) will be used to give longer seal life.

# Electricals:

The machine features a powerful 5 HP motor, single phase (30 amp), Power requirement is 240 Volt, 60 hertz supply. Other voltages available.

# Applications:

The machine can handle a variety of jobs involving reduction, expansion, beading, cone/ cup formation etc.
These machines are compact & need less floor space, controlled by PLC.

# Power Pack:

The power pack consists of a Hydraulic Pump driven by electric motor. The pump is capable of developing a pressure of 206 kg/cm.sq. The pack is designed taking into account all hydraulic and service requirements.
