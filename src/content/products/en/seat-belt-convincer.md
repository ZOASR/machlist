**The collision simulation unit is an educational machine used to train individuals in a simulation of a car collision. And realize the power that results from it. The importance of using a seat belt in this regard.**
**The process begins with the trainee riding on the sliding chair and fastening the seat belt. Then the chair is released by pressing the electrical switches on the side operating panel. The chair begins to slide on its own as a result of the existing tilt. It continues to slide and increase speed until a collision occurs at the end of the path.**
**The collision occurred at a rate calculated so that it does not harm the passenger and at the same time shows the importance of the seat belt.**
