_Engraving machine_

Engraving machine is used to engrave ornamental shapes in sequential order as it is used in wooden frames and furniture or likes.
The machine works by making a die for desired shape and mounting it in the machine; Then the die vibrates in high frequency which leads to engraving the die shape on any facing material without applying any force or impact on work piece.

_Automatic and manual controls_

By fixing a work piece on feeding unit and adjusting the machine at desired depth and height ; The machine starts automatically to engrave till adjusted depth is reached and then the feeding unit advances the work piece to next engraving location and so on until the work piece is finished.
The machine could be controlled manually through manual control panel. In manual operation the work piece could be moved right, left, front and back during vibration. Feeding could be controlled manually also to create non regular shapes.
