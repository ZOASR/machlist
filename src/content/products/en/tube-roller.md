Pyramid style Roll Bender is three driving roll machine with adjustable center distances.

It is used to bent tubes in continuous operation to form regular shapes using two lower rolls as a support and upper roll for bending action.

All rolls adjustment are controlled by a hydraulic cylinders and the rolls revolution has been achieved by two speeds electric motor.

Roll Bender is suitable in bending steel profiles, square and rectangular tubes, round tubes and flats.

The universal rolls have a knurled surface for a better result in material feeding.

# General features:

-   Roll former with Three driving rolls
-   Pyramid style Roll Former shape
-   All rolls has center distance adjustment using hydraulic cylinders
-   Bending in progressive adjustment to get perfect bending radius without wrinkling
-   Roll sets is easy to change according to tube profile (Delivered with one flat set)
-   Side control panel includes pressure gauge, oil level indicator, motors on/off switches, General power switch beside overload and fuse.
-   Roll rotation and and center distances are controlled from side control panel or pedal unit
-   Pedal unit is used for regular operation to adjust center distance and operate rolls at low or high speed
-   Tube roller could be used in the vertical or horizontal position
