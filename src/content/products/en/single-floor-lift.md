The internal elevator is used to work inside buildings and facilities, whether public or private, as it is installed between two specific floors in the building and works between them as an internal elevator in addition to the general elevator of the building, if any.
This feature usually serves wheelchair users, the elderly, and patients, as they face difficulties in climbing stairs, even to one floor. Therefore, this elevator can be installed in hospitals, nursing homes, and even in villas, private homes, and the like.
