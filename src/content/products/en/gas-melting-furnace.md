The melting furnace has been designed for Melting small size lump scrap nonferrous metals and waste metal shavings covered with oil or grinding slurry without preliminary cleaning.

The product of melting, depending on initial raw material, can be either a branded metal, or an ingot for a further processing.
Melting is carried out in a layer of liquid synthetic slag blown with high-temperature gaseous products of fuel combustion.

Furnace is designed to meet the high production demands of industry. it is made of heavy gauge welded steel with rugged cast iron legs and top rims.

Furnace is designed for melting lead, babbitt, tin, zinc, type metal, scrap and all other low or medium-fusion metals and alloys.

Furnace comes equipped with powerful burner. Heavy insulation assures fast melting and recovery rate.

Furnace can be operated on either natural (NAT) or liquid propane (LP) gas.

Furnace is equipped with Automatic Digital Temperature Controller, Cast Iron Pot, Thermocouple with Stainless Steel Protection Tube & Bracket, Combo Gas Solenoid & Safety Valve & Auxiliary Pilot.

## High Quality Products

The excellent insulation of our furnaces is ensured by seven inches of insulated brick. This high quality insulation allows a better heat and energy distribution, which improves the crucible life expectancy.
Our furnace comes with a digital indicating controller allowing to reach and maintain a precise temperature.
Our melting furnaces are designed for an intensive and continuous use. They offer very good melting capacity and low operating costs.

## Ease of Operation

Our melting furnace is easy to install. At delivery, the control system is already in place. With no special foundation required, our furnace is operational in a couple of hours. Furthermore, the crucible can be replaced easily.
