A 30-ton hydraulic press for working in die operations. It can also be used to work within the rolled sections production line. The piston is equipped with places to install the special molding mold in the required shape. The mold consists of two pieces, one of which is installed in the upper part of the piston and the other in the lower part. The press is equipped with an optional pulling unit that automatically pulls sheet metal at specific distances used for automation.
The press is operated by a hydraulic control valve that can be operated manually for manual operation, and it can also be operated automatically with the drawing unit to automatically perform perforations at the required distances.
