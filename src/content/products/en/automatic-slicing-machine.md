_Automatic Slicing machine_

Automatic slicing machine is used to slice rods and bars automatically into equal slices after fast setup for required dimensions. These slices may be used in woodworks; Decoration and many industrial applications.

In addition to slicing rods and bars; Slicing machine can convert small ships and wooden wastes into regular small shapes where small ships are fed to feeding unit sequentially and the feeding unit pushes these ships to slicing disk as if it is a continues peice.

By fixing a work piece on feeding unit and adjusting the machine at desired length and angles; The machine starts automatically to cut and then the feeding unit advances the work piece to next slicing location and so on until the work piece is finished.

The machine could be controlled manually through manual handles and switches in control panel . In manual operation the slicing disk could be moved front and back during cutting. Feeding could be controlled manually also to create non regular slices.

Automatic slicing machine works on wood, metals, plastics and stones or any like materials where the cutting disk is changed according to worked material.
