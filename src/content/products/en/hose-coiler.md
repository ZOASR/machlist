# Hose winding machine

The hose winding machine works within the flexible hose manufacturing lines. It pulls the hose and feeds it to the winding unit.
It stacks the hose during winding, then it cuts the hose at the required length. It also transfers the winding to the other side and stops the first side until the hose roll is removed.

The machine is equipped with two hose winding units, one of which is wound while the worker removes the coil from the other unit and prepares the unit for a new coil.

The machine is also equipped with a hose stacking unit, which stacks the hose during winding to the required length and then cuts the hose while changing the winding from the right side to the left side.

_Side view of the machine with automatic control panel_

All movements of the machine are controlled automatically from the control panel, and all movements can be controlled manually from the manual operation switches on the control panel. Manual control is usually used while adjusting the machine to new hose sizes or lengths.

The machine is characterized by ease of operation, as the worker rotates the hand to open the jaw and then presses the winding button. The machine then begins directing the hose to the jaw and begins rotating with automatic stacking to the required length, which is pre-programmed in the PLC unit on the machine’s control panel. When the required length is reached, the winding process moves automatically to the opposite side of the machine, with the hose cut during the move while the worker ties the finished roll and takes it out of the machine.

To remove the roll from the machine, the worker turns the jaw opening hand in the opposite direction, and after removing the roll, he reopens the jaw in preparation for another winding process.
