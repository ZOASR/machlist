Wire drawing machine is stepped cone type suitable for drawing non-ferrous metals like Aluminum and Copper using a numbers of dies in tandem. The machines have horizontally mounted stepped capstans which are hardened and ground finished. The drive to individual capstan shaft is provided through spur gears. The gear train is housed in steel fabricated solid body and is oil immersed for smooth running. The die holders are adjustable and are provided between each capstan unit. Separate pipeline is provided over each die for forced lubrication and cleaning of dies.

The wire drawing machines are used to draw copper and aluminum alloys.. the wire drawing machine is consisted of main reduction box, die casting, wheel frame, wire brace and electrical control system

Compared with other wet type wire drawing machine, our wet type wire drawing machine enjoys many advantages including: more reasonable structure, more compact appearance, smoother operating, higher efficiency and is easy to operate and maintain.
