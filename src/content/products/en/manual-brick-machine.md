Manual brick laying is used in brick production operations in a quick, easy and manual way without complicated machines due to its small size and ease of use, as one worker can use this machine to produce more than four thousand pieces of bricks per day.

The plaster works after placing the mortar mixture manually in the upper hopper, which is at a low height to facilitate the process of placing the mortar. Then the plaster is pulled to the place where the bricks are placed, and the pulling arm is raised to the fixing position, as this position prevents the plaster from rotating while walking and allows it to move in a straight line only.

To place two pieces of brick, the small arm is pulled down, then the large arm is pulled down and pressed with a force of about 30 kg, which becomes 600 kg at the surface of the brick, which is equivalent to a pressure of 4 Newtons per square centimeter, which is sufficient to manufacture a good piece of brick.

After that, the small arm is raised first, then the large arm, to find two pieces of bricks having been made under the plaster, and the plaster is moved forward a small distance sufficient to place two new pieces of bricks.

The work also continues in a straight line until the mortar shipment from the hopper is finished, which is sufficient for about 60 pieces of hollow bricks, measuring 20 cm by 20 cm by 40 cm. Usually the hopper is filled with mortar during the brick laying process, and an additional worker is required for this if there is a desire to increase production.

# Technical Specifications

-   The sheet is made of sheet metal with a thickness of 3 mm and 5 mm
-   The machine is loaded on four wheels for easy towing
-   The front wheels are equipped with a traction ring through which the platform can be guided while driving
-   The diameter of the rear wheels is 60 cm to bear the weight and obtain sufficient height to place bricks
-   The bricks are manufactured by manually pressing the large arm with a force of about 30 kg, with a manual vibration to improve the pressing process.
-   The machine is equipped with an additional back weight that works to balance the machine when the operating arm is extended to obtain greater pressure
-   The machine is equipped with a set of levers and internal gears to transform the force of manual pressure to about 900 kg, which is equivalent to a pressure of 6 Newtons per square cm.
-   The body of the machine is treated against rust and painted with two layers of rust-proof paint and two layers of final color.
