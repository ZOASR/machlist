The barrel rolling machine is used to bend the ends of the barrels to form a dowel, whether to strengthen the edges of the barrels or to attach the bottom or lid to the barrel body.

The machine works with a group of rollers distributed in a pyramidal shape, where the lower rollers work during the operation of the machine to determine the rolling path, while the upper roller works to apply great pressure to perform the bending process.
The machine is also equipped with a rear jaw that works to stabilize the barrel during rolling, in addition to giving front feed to the barrel.

At a fixed rate for each cycle. The machine is also equipped with a set of rollers to load the barrel during the rolling process.
Internal parts of the machine. Turning the machine on and off is controlled from an electrical control panel, and the direction of rotation can be changed when needed from the electrical control panel.

It is equipped with the necessary operating and protection switches.
