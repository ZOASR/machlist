Storage Silo is used to store different kinds of grains and cereals with large storage capacity in addition to easy charging and discharging.

The silo is constructed from many separate sections which are attached together in site in case of overseas freight. Whole silo is mounted on robust base which may be fixed to ground.

Silo is supported with outer ladder for service ,Inner ladder for maintenance, Upper rail for safety and upper man hole for manual filling and maintenance. It is also provided with two pneumatic conveyors to automatically convey cereals from any container to silo and from silo to any container. We may use one pneumatic conveyor sometimes.

By connecting a hose to left conveyor and putting hose end in any cereals container; Just one push button and the cereals will flow to silo with a rate up to 20 ton/hr.

Another hose is connected to right conveyor , Then we can discharge cereals from silo to any containers with the same filling rate.
