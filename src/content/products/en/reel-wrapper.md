Reel Wrapper Machine has been specially designed for packing products like Cable reels, Wire reels Paper rolls, foils, film rolls etc. manufactured in the form of mini Rolls/ Reels.

This is an axial wrapping machine. The machine when set to operate will apply layers of **'Pre-stretched'** Film across the face diametrically and wrap them along the longitudinal axis.

The longitudinally applied wraps are moved along the periphery with uniform overlap as the reel is rotating continuously, resulting in a cocoon type of final packing.

# Applications:

-   Suitable for Foil Rolls, Flexible packages, coils, cables and Spools
-   Pneumatically operated holder provision for accommodating wide range of Reel Diameters as well as Reel widths
-   Completely automatic cycle of operation
-   Powered pre-stretch unit ensures stronger packing, while consuming very low quantity of film
-   Counter displays Consumption of Film and percentage of stretch applied for each roll
-   Easy to operate Table Top Model
-   Wide range of film materials can be used
-   Results in uniform and completely moisture-proof and dust-proof packing

Retread Rubber, Paper, Film, Foils, etc., in Reel form, cannot be easily wrapped with protective wrappers manually due to their shape, weight & tenderness. Our reel Wrapper is suitable for the above products.

The machine uses 220V, 1-phase, 0.75 KW power supply.

With the use of a pneumatically operated holder, this machine can quickly stretch wrap "Reels" of various sizes in width & diameter, weighing even up to 100 Kgs., resulting in a cocoon type axial wrapping.

Electronic drives and PLC based cycle programmer and monitor ensure uniform consumption of film for all the reels, once we preset. For the economical consumption of the stretch film, the inbuilt powered pre-stretch unit stretches the LLDPE stretchable cling film upto 300% before wrapping over the reel. The Counter in the Control Panel gives the Stretch % & the quantity of film consumed for each reel.

This method of packing using Stretch Film gives the reel a excellent protection from dust & moisture and ensures longer storage life. It also keeps the packing cost very low, compared to packing them with Craft Paper .
