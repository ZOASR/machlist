**The rollover simulation unit simulates the movement of the car turning over while driving, with the aim of training the user to use the seat belt and understand the movement of the car during a rollover.**
**The movement begins with the user getting into the car and fastening the seat belt. The car is then rotated around its axis from the side operating panel. The car continues to rotate for a full revolution or several revolutions to demonstrate the importance of the seat belt in this.**
**The unit is easy to use, operate and maintain as it is mounted on wheels and equipped with a front tow ring for easy transportation and movement.**

**It is also equipped with front and rear supports for installation while working and is equipped with a side ladder to facilitate use**
**The parts of the unit are manufactured on laser machines and are assembled by linking without any welds to facilitate maintenance and changing spare parts**
**Each piece has its own serial number and drawing for remanufacturing when needed**
