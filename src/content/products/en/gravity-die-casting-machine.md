Gravity die casting machine is one of the most important machines commonly used in die casting plants where it has a good surface finish products and high productivity which means fewer processes in production.

Many small and medium products could be cast using this machine like valves, taps, metal ornaments and likes .

It is also used in semi products casting for industrial use and for many spare parts production.

The machine is available for frontal or lateral pouring with regulation of the rotation speed. Quick regulation of the pouring start points .

The Die closing will be very soft by means of fast and slow speed to avoid any damages to the cores
